				<p class="intro">
					November 2012, Startup Weekend Groningen. In a beautiful castle right in the city centre of Groningen my journey started. For 12 months I traveled through the hyped-up landscape of startups, just to end up in the same place...</p>

<p>From accelerator programs in Amsterdam and Dallas, pitch events in Eindhoven, San Francisco and everything in between, from The Next Web conference to TechCrunch Disrupt I've seen it all. A journey that included, paddle boarding in the Pacific Ocean, a hackathon on a bus, awesome waterslides in Tenerife and a lot more. I walked acros the Facebook campus, rode a Google bike, and fell asleep at the Soundcloud office in Berlin. All these events had one word in common, <i>startup</i>.</p>

<p>I've seen all kinds of nerds, geeks, designers, hipsters, entrepreneurs, marketeers, coders, geniuses, investors and bloggers. I've been impressed by all of them. I think there has been a point that I wanted to be each and every one of them.</p>

<p>Along the way I've felt discurraged by little 15 year old entrepreneurs. I've been hyped up by inspiring talks, scared by mean looking investors and comforted by unexpected mentors. Until I found myself back in that same castle in the city centre of Groningen. The same kid, just one tini tiny year older...</p>

<p>"Running a startup is a wild journey", that is something you hear everywhere. We even gave it a name, startuplife. Like it's a lifestyle. Now I won't disagree with this, I probably said myself a couple of times.</p>

<p>Recently, I started my first real startup job at Gibbon. A startup from Leiden, The Netherlands.</p>

<p>After my wild year living the startup life, traveling, networking, drinking beer, listing to pitches and drinking some more beer. I finally entered the real startup life. One where I actually have responsibilities, one where I have to make decisions, one where everything is for real.</p>

<p>I have been working at Gibbon for about two months I can say one thing. It's scary as hell!! All the experience I thought I had now seems worthless, all the things I thought I knew, now just seems a fraction of everything I need to know.</p>

<p>Standing on the sideline and asking questions to the people who are actually doing it is easy, but to go out there and answer those questions.. that is a whole different story. Although I sometimes feel a bit scared, or unsure which road to take I never feel discuraged.</p>

<p>The guys I work with. My team, has one thing that always comforts me. That is experience. Wouter, Joery and Petar have been working together for about five years. They set up a succesful web-agency together, and have been building software together for years. It's safe to say they know their shit.</p>

<p>Working with people that know their shit brings a lot of piece to mind. At least to me. Whenever something goes wrong, they fix it with ease. Maybe they are stressed as well on the inside, but all I get hear is a nerdy joke about how we are going to buy Facebook next week, and a big smile.</p>

<p>This experience showed me two things:</p>

<blockquote><p>1. Team is everything. (yes, I heard over and over again at every startup event, but now I know why) This makes me extra proud to be on the Gibbon team.</p>
<p>2. Everybody will tell you something you should do. Don't go crazy over this, take on the advise that feels right, and don't forget how much you actually know.</p></blockquote>

<p>I'm looking forward to my time ahead at Gibbon, and hopefully we'll be around for a while.</p>

<p>A big thank you to everybody who I got the meet over the last year. I learned from every single one of you, hopefully I'll be able to help others in the future as well.</p>

				<p class="intro">
					<p>Throughout the whole process of graduating I've had a certain 'this is bullshit' mentality. By traveling halfway around the globle, meeting certain companies and people I found out that I'm able to opperate at a certain level. This gave me a confidence to keep telling the world I was ready to start working and I should just get my diploma. This was again confirmed at the The Next Web conference last week. I was able to get a free ticket, because I worked myself into a project for The Next Web and the boss himself offferd me a ticket. 

					This gave me an incredible, look at me I'm cool aditude. Being able to tell people, "see that guy on stage moderating this whole thing and every wants to talk to.. he gave me a â‚¬800,- ticket to this conference". However within a week this changed.. or maybe it even changed while I was at the conference. When I was walking home on Friday night after the conference.. and stared to think back on all the keynotes I watched and people I had talked to it suddenly hit me. There were so many smart people at this conference... who was I to say I'm ready to take on a this job at Gibbon.. why did I feel so confident about myself. 

					This struck me... It raised a centrain fair: Can I do this job, am I able to opperate at this level, or am I just pretending. Afraid of the answer I turned to an old habbit, and the whole weekend and I completely shut myself off..   The NBA playoff started the week before and I decited as a true fan I should watch some games. I started wachting.. and kept watching until late Sunday night, completly skipped Kingsday (the biggest party day in Amsterdam...) In total I watched nine basketball games, and went to work monday with a fresh start.

					Looking unchanged in my thoughs and mentality, but without knowing I had used the weekend to process all my experiences from the last 6 months orso.. The most important thing I realized was that; yes.. there were a lot of smart people, but yet.. I did not feel stupid either... I was not stupid, I'm able to connect with these people and have discussions. I just realized something I already know for a long time.. The most important thing is that I keep in imporving myself, becuase that is what all these 'smart people' did and are still doing. If I'm not learning somehting everyday, I'm not working on the right thigns. 

					This so to call personal ephihany gave me a whole new motivation and approach to my graduation project. Where before I was only resreaching the parts I already knew, I now dove into the parts I was not to sure about. Really taking a deepdive into the more technical side of things, and in five days I've learned more than I did in the last two months. It's amazing, all the little parts are falling into place and each paragraph I write motivates me to research and write the next one!

					In a way I exactly out of The Next Web Conference what it intends to do, inspire and motivate to take the next step. This really brought back the relevance for me and Gibbon in my graduation project. Now I just hope I have enought time to finish everything up before summer, but the motivation and dedication is certainly there :)

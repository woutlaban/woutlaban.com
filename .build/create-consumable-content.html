				<p class="intro">
					You only have a few seconds to catch my attention, thats it. If you get me to click you probably have about 20 more to convince me to watch the rest of your one minute video. If your video is longer than one minute... forget it!</p>

<p>Video is a very powerful media to get a message across. We all have seen the beautiful vimeo type of videos where a very, very, very good videographer documents the story of, for example a local boat maker. It is lovely to see, and it tells a true authentic story. Inspiring by any standard.</p>

<p>The hype of creating these videos with a highly emotional touch hit the startup world as well. Everywhere these videos popped up. Telling the story of an entrepreneur, his struggles, the personal connection to the problem he is solving, and how amazing it felt when people first used his product.</p>

<p>Now here is the thing. I might be a little extreme here, but I will do that just to make sure you get my point. Whenever I watch a video like that about a startup. I will understand the product within one minute. Right at that moment your video should stop and take me to your product straight away, no hurdles.</p>

<p>At that moment I want see the product, I want to touch it, play with it, try it out.</p>

<p>After I get in touch with the product, and hopefully fell in love with it. I am ready to hear the rest of your story. I want to hear your story, that is what will get me emotionally attached to your product. So, here is I believe what your startup video should look like:</p>

<blockquote><p>1. Create a very good 30 second video.</p>
<p>2. Make sure that when the video is finished, you take me straight to your product.</p>
<p>3. Create about 5 more 20 second videos where you tell your story.</p></blockquote>

<p>Video is not a tv commercial anymore, it cannot stand alone. Your video should be completly integrated with the whole on-boarding experience. The first video is just to get me signed up. The rest of your story should convince me to stay, comeback and share your product.</p>

<p>To sum up: Create bite sized pieces of content that are easily to consume.</p>

<p>If you have any examples of startup that this right, I would love to see them.</p>

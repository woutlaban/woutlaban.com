					<p>I love working at Gibbon, the product is great, the guys are great, but the thing I love the most are the endless possibilaties. Everyday there is a chance that something will happen that can change the course of the company. An idea for a feature, a mention by a big influencer, a call from an invester who wants to meet.. or absolutly nothing.  

					The first three are cool, exiciting, and make you feel incredebily good. The last one in devistating. Even though it's far from the end of the world, but if nothing happens on a day, if the signups are far below average... you don't even get a single mention on twitter.. this weird feeling comes up. Even though you can't do anything about it.. some days are just like that, still this hopeless feeling comes up. 
					
					You basically freeze, even though you want to do somehting, the fear of failing shows up and all your actions seem scary. You doub't your writing, everything seems stupid, even answering simple emails feel unconfortable. 

					On days like this it's hard to turn off. It sticks with you, there is no feeling of satiscation or completion. If building a startup is like climbing mountain in the fog.. you don't know where the top is but there is also no way back.. you keep climbing. But there are days were do not make any progress.. those are the day when the sky clears up and shows you exactly how big the mountain is you're climbing. It is really David vs. Goliath. 

					The worst thing is you are not the only on fighting the mountain... there are at least 25 others, and they all seem to do better then you, they all seem smarter than you... These days are the most difitcult.

					I found out that the best way to deal with this is to shut down. Let the day go by, go do somehitng totally different. Watch a movie, grab a drink with a friend who knows nothing about this whole game. Start again fresh the next day, put things in perspective and soon enough good things will happen again. although this sounds like solid advice and quite simple to do, it's not. 

					Shutting down, leaving it be is hard. Esspecially when things are not rolling the way you want to. I find myself staring at my screen, looking at stats.. waiting for something to change.. it's useless but and weird.. It does not make sense why I do it, but when you are overcome by fear it feels like to only thing you can do.

					Until you are brave enough to take the first step again..

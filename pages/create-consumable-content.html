				<p class="intro">
					Ambition is a beatiful thing. Everybody has it. Sometimes it is hard to see, but it is there. I used to judge people on their lack of ambition, but what can be very ambitious to me can be pointless to someone else. Therefore someone's ambition might be invisable to you and me, but that does not mean it is inexsitable.</P> 

					<p>Although I truly believe everybody has ambition, but-- I'm also convinced that not everybody is challening the status quo to act upon this ambition. Over the last couple of year this is one of the most importand lessons I've learned; How to-- 	take action on my ambitious goals and-- bring myself in the position to continuously improve myself.</p> 

					<P>Dispite everything, I've masterd ambition through my education. With <i>dispite everything</i>, I am refering to my endless complaints about our educations system. People close to me know what I'm talking about.</P>

					<p>Throughout my four year bachelor program, at CMD Leeuwarden I very gratitidly developed myself into a young professional with the perfect fit for the ambition I want to persue.</p> 

					<P>There are a few teachers that thought me one very important lesson that helped to what I call now Mastering Ambition. And they did it with one question, or it was more a call to action than a quesiton. It took my three years to answer.</P>

					<p><i>"Find your hero"</i></P>

				

					<p>This is the single greatest thing they thaught me. To find others to guide me, find mentors that will challege you.</p>

					<p>Learn to put yourslef in the position the where you will challenge to learn more.</p> 

					<p>If they would not have taught me that from day one I would have never been where I am today. For the very first day they challenged me to go out and find others to teach me, becuase there is a lot more knowlegde out there than in the classroom.</p>

					<p>Now this might sound simple and to do this once is easy, but to do this over and over again... That is something else.</p>

					<p>If I have to say I mastered one thing, it's ambition and taking action on my ambition.</p>

					<p>This is something I find truly amazing, these moments when an educator is able to motivate and challenge a student even when they have started to operate above their own level. When the student becomes the master... Now let me be clear, I'm far from a master, but I've reached a new level where I'm learning further.</p>

					<p>Every time I hit a ceiling my teachers gave me a new platform to operate on. Bringing me a perfect balance of challenge and selfconfidence. Even when they knew I was outgrowing the limits of system and curiciulem they were able to challenge me. </P>

					<p>And like I said I could not have done it without my education. These teachers gave me the time to explore and make mistake, to wander around and</p>

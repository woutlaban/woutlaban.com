				<p class="intro">
				A few weeks back I was catching up with a friend from my university, who I had not seen for a while. Even though this is not my best friend in the world we have always had a solid connection both personally and professionally.</p>

				<p>The larger part of our conversation was about the transition from being a student to a professional. About the ambitions we had and projects we were currently working on. For me the the last couple of months had been quite busy, working full-time at a early stage startup, writing my bachelor thesis and organising Startup Weekend Amsterdam (the last two had a deadline within 10 days).
				</p><p>
				After talking to this friend for about two hours he finally asked me: "but how are you doing? You're only taking about work and projects... Are you doing anything besides this, are you having fun?"
				</p><p>
				Not really knowing the answer to this question, I told him a cliché answer that work was not really work for me. That I loved what I was doing and that it was all I needed. Even though I completely agreed with the answer at that time… and still do. The question kept popping up in my head.
				</p><p>
				I knew that my personal life had been a bit on the down low and I was focussing more on work. The transition from being a partying college student, to a full time job at a startup came very naturally to me and the changes that came with that personally as well. <br>
				After a couple of days of thinking about this question, I realised more then ever that I do miss a certain personal having fun, festival going, partying side of me, but that the drive and ambition to continue myself professionally is bigger than that. 
				</p><p>
				Like I wrote in the post about mastering ambition I have seen what the next level looks like and I can't wait to play (and of course fail) in that level. This keeps my motivation at such a high level that I just do not want to stop learning and working. </p>

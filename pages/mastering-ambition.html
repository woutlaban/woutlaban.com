			Over the last year my ambition took control over me. I find it a truly beautiful thing, the hunger of taking the next step, always wanting to improve, always wanting to know and do more...
			</p><p>
			Having ambition is one thing, taking action on ambition it is another. To actually work towards your goals is something a lot harder than it seems. In this post I share how I've learned on how to take action on my ambition. 
			</p><p>	
			Over the last couple of years there were a few teachers that taught me a very important lesson. Simply by asking one question, or actually it was more of a call to action. They told me, “find your heroes”. It took me three years before I finally understood what this truly meant. 
			</p><p>
			Throughout my education these teachers kept on pushing me to find others to guide me, find mentors that will challenge me, and find heroes to look up to. By getting out of the building and talking to professionals (people that on a daily basis do the work I wanted to do) and before I knew it I got involved with projects far outside the safe school environment. 
			</p><p>	
			Working on these projects I was surrounded with people that could either give me guidance or people I looked up to. Being in these situations triggered my ambition. If you look at like a game these people showed me the next level. They showed me what kind of cool superpowers and features I could get if I completed this level. This goes for creating great products as as well as the people you can interact and brainstorm with. Every time I competed a level it showed me a preview of the next, which was even more exciting!  
			</p><p>	
			The road-map of my game took me into the world of entrepreneurship. An extremely ambitious environment. A place where there is always opportunity to do and be more. A place where you try to complete mission impossible with with minimal resources.
			</p><p>	
			If my teachers would not have pushed me to go out and see what the next level of the game was going to be like I would not been able connect as wel as I do now in this world of entrepreneurship. From the very first day they taught me that there is a lot more knowledge out in the world than in the small classrooms. This attitude really helped me to continue to develop myself. Everyone I talk to these days - at a network-event or just for a random coffee - I try to learn from. Every conversation I have or every article I read shows me a preview of the next level and I try to gain the knowledge needed that will bring me one step closer to play and compete in that level. 
			</p><p>	
			To develop this kind of ambition you have to actively interact with the people you look up to. This can be be someone close to you, at the company you work, but it can also be on the other side of the world, someone who is very hard to contact and certainly cannot guide you on daily basis. Though I still encourage you to contact these people, show your appreciation of the lessons they teach you without them knowing. They are people too, they will respond to your emails or messages. 
			</p><p>	
			The moments when you get an unexpected reply from someone you truly admire can give you the confidence to keep on going. Because taking on the challenge of reaching your ambition is hard. It's the part they fast forward in the movies where actually all the work gets done. Those are the actual hard times, when you have put in the work and run the extra mile. In in the end making the crossroad decisions is easy. The work to get to that decision is the hard part. If you are up for the task, you need heroes to guide you and every time you enter a new level... you need to find new mentors. If you succeed in doing this time after time, then you've mastered your ambition.
			</p><p>	
			It's something that helped me get to the point where I'm today (Which is still noting special), but also gives me the confidence that I can keep on going. Because I know it's in my system that I will always look for mentors to guide me through the next level.</p>

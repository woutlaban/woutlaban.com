				I truly enjoy working at Gibbon, the product is great, the team is great, but the thing I love the most are the endless possibilities you encounter when building a startup. Every day there is a chance that something might happen that could change the course of the company: an idea for a feature, a mention by a big influencer, a call from an investor who wants to meet... anything. Things like that are exciting and bring direct results to a small company. These actions make you feel incredibly good, a little invincible even. 
				</p><p>
				Yet, there are also days that are completely the opposite... There are days where absolutely nothing happens. Days where the signups are lower than normal, no exciting e-mails come in and you get stuck on bugs that you can't seem to solve. Days like that are devastating. You give your best effort to make something positive happen, but you can't even get a single mention on Twitter... Even though it is not the end of the world, it does make a certain hopeless feeling come up.
				</p><p>	
				In these moments you realise how huge the mountain is that you're trying to climb and how far the road to the top still is. This feeling of desperation will freeze you up, suddenly everything you do feels not good enough and you start to doubt yourself. You are overcome by a fear of failing, yet you can't stop either… You want to continue, you want do something that will make everything right again... You refuse to give up because you know it can work.
				</p><p>
				I've found out that on days like this it's best to just shut everything off. Let the day go by and go do something totally different. Watch a movie, grab a drink with a friend. The next day you have a fresh start and you can put things in perspective. You'll see it was just one day and it won't certainly be the last... More good and bad days will come. <br>
				Although this sounds quite simple to do, it's not. Shutting down and 'leaving it be', is hard. Especially when put your total 100% dedication in to the thing you do and things are not going as planned. Still, I find the best thing to do is try to let go, the world will not fall apart if you skip a day. Better yet nobody will probably notice you skipped a day.

				<img class="blog-img" src="img/blog/heart.png">
				<p class="intro">

					<p>Community members, fans, users, Gibbons, minions or even lovers. Whatever name you give them does not matter, the goal is the same. You want to have that critical group of people that will become ambassadors of your product. People that are so happy with your product that they will get their friends to use it.</p>

					<p>In his book Tribes, Seth Godin talks about that you only need a 1000 people that love your message to build a sustainable community around your product. A 1000 people that will advocate your message and will help to grow your community.</p>

					<p>Getting these first 1000 lovers is not something that goes overnight. You have to realize not every user is a lover. A lover will email his friends full of excitement; “You have to check out this thing I just found, NOW!!”.</p>

					<p>With the amount of content shared these days the search for exposure has become an everlasting journey. Content marketing, social media strategies and growth hacks. There are tons of ways to get people in touch with your product. The truth is there is no easy way. Which ever road you take. It’s all very hard work…</p>

					<p>We were fortunate enough to get featured on TechCrunch. You could almost consider this a milestone in the startup journey, but this does not mean you can sit back and relax. It’s a great start, but what did it really bring us? It definitely spiked our Twitter timeline, but the amount of visitors that reached our website was almost a bit disappointing.</p>

					<p>What TechCrunch did bring us was a stamp of approval. Other smaller blogs and news sites picked up our story and shared it. Also the people you meet and talk to, even complete strangers that say;</p>
						
					<p class="quote">"I saw you were on TC so I guess your startup is legit."</p>

					<p>All this got us a lot of attention, and even signups, but it did not create lovers. At least not instantly. To create lovers you have to connect with your users. During the first weeks after our launch we did the following. Every user that signed up received an email from us. Just a simple plain text email where we asked about their first experience with Gibbon. The amount of feedback we received was overwhelming, we started our day with at least an hour of answering emails, each.</p>
					
					<p class="quote">"Btw, absolutely LOVE what you guys have built in gibbon. I am a huge fan and hope you guys continue the amazing work!"</p>

					<p>This was the moment where we turned users in to lovers. Two things stood out:<p>

					<p>1. Even though most people knew it was an automated email, they still replied because it was a plain text email. The real surprise came when we actually answered the email.
					Because we answered every email personally, people felt engaged. This kickstarted a conversation, with some users this went up to 10 emails.</p>
					<p>2. From these emails we got feature requests, we validated assumptions, got internship applications and lots and lots of love. It was was a hell of a job, but the amount of insights we got from this made it all worth it.</p>

					<p>Growing a community around your product is hard work. We hope to turn everyone, of the thousands of people that sign up for Gibbon into a lover. Communicating your message is not always easy, but I’m strong believer that quality content will get people to love your product. For me, that is far more important than a 9gag like meme that goes ‘viral’ on our Facebook page.</p>

					<p>So to all Gibbons, please keep on mailing, Tweeting, Facebooking or Google+ing.</p>

					<p>Hope to talk soon!</p>

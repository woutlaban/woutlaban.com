					Dream big, a quote that I've been infected with. Sometimes it feels like a little virus. Last time I wrote about ambiton and mastering it. Dreaming big is something that fits right in there. 

					Over the last couple of years I have learnd to think big, and bigger. But within dreaming big there is one small leasson that you have to understand; if you want your dream to become reality, you have to with a first step. It's imposible to jump streight to the perfect world, It may sound cliche, but still true. 

					A thing I like to do these days is look back on the projects I did, or things I have achieved and try to find the first step of the journey. What was the little pebble that made caused the avlance of experiences that came from it. I get a lot of energy from traveling back in time and to start connecting the dots. It's amzing to see the web of interactions you create by takeing alle kinds of frist steps. When you visulize this, if it's in your mind or actually in a graphic you start to realize that none of them are actually first steps, just next steps. 

					Taking a first step sounds scary, but at the moment you think you need to take a first step you are actually taking a next step. Something already got you in the place where you are now, so don't worry there are no first steps, just next steps.
